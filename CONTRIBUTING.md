## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. **Check existing issues** to avoid duplicates
2. **Use the bug report template** when creating new issues
3. **Include detailed information**:
   - Operating system and version
   - Python version
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features

1. **Check the roadmap** in CHANGELOG.md
2. **Open a feature request** with:
   - Clear description of the feature
   - Use cases and benefits
   - Possible implementation approach

### Code Contributions

#### 1. Choose an Issue
- Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
- Check `help wanted` for priority contributions
- Comment on the issue to claim it

#### 2. Create a Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

#### 3. Make Changes
- Follow the coding standards below
- Write clear, documented code
- Test your changes thoroughly

#### 4. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
# or
git commit -m "fix: resolve bug description"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code restructuring
- `test:` for adding tests

#### 5. Push and Create Pull Request
```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Then create a pull request with:
- Clear title and description
- Reference related issues
- List of changes made
- Screenshots for UI changes

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow **PEP 8** style guidelines
- Use **4 spaces** for indentation
- **Maximum line length**: 88 characters
- Use **meaningful variable names**

### Code Structure

```python
# Good example
class NotesManager:
    """Manages note operations like create, read, update, delete."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.notes = []
    
    def add_note(self, title: str, content: str) -> int:
        """Add a new note and return its ID."""
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Documentation

- **Docstrings** for all classes and methods
- **Inline comments** for complex logic
- **Type hints** where appropriate
- **Clear variable names** that explain purpose

### UI Guidelines

- **Consistent theming** across all elements
- **Responsive design** that works on different screen sizes
- **Keyboard accessibility** for all features
- **Clear visual hierarchy** and spacing

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Test all features** after making changes
2. **Try both light and dark themes**
3. **Test with and without API key configured**
4. **Verify keyboard shortcuts work**
5. **Test error scenarios**

### Automated Testing (Future)

We're working on implementing automated tests. Contributions to testing infrastructure are welcome!
